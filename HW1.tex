Problem 1. Let \(G\) be a group and let \(a, b \in G\).\\
i) Show that \((a b)^{-1}=b^{-1} a^{-1}\).\\
ii) Give an example to show that we might not have \((a b)^{-1}=a^{-1} b^{-1}\).

Problem 2. Show that if \(f: G_{1} \rightarrow G_{2}\) and \(g: G_{2} \rightarrow G_{3}\) are group homomorphisms (isomorphisms), then the composition \(g \circ f\) is a group homomorphism (respectively, isomorphism).

Problem 3. Let \(G\) be a group such that \(x^{2}=e\) for every \(x \in G\). Show that \(G\) is abelian.

Problem 4. Let \(G\) be a group. The center of \(G\) is

\[
Z(G)=\{a \in G \mid a b=b a \text { for all } b \in G\} .
\]

Show that \(Z(G)\) is a subgroup of \(G\).

For the following problem, we note that an automorphism of a group \(G\) is a group isomorphism \(G \rightarrow G\).

Problem 5. For a group \(G\), we denote by \(\operatorname{Aut}(G)\) the set of all automorphisms of \(G\).\\
i) Show that \(\operatorname{Aut}(G)\) is a group with respect to composition.\\
ii) Show that that for every \(g \in G\), the map \(\varphi_{g}: G \rightarrow G\) given by \(\varphi_{g}(x)=g x g^{-1}\) is an automorphism of \(G\).\\
iii) Show that the map

\[
G \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(G), \quad g \mapsto \varphi_{g}
\]

is a group homomorphism whose kernel is \(Z(G)\).

Problem 6. Show that the exponential map gives an isomorphism between ( \(\mathbf{R},+\) ) and \(\left(\mathbf{R}_{>0}, \cdot\right)\).

The following problem extends a result proved in class.\\
Problem 7. Let \(f: G \rightarrow H\) be a group homomorphism.\\
i) Show that if \(G^{\prime}\) is a subgroup of \(G\), then

\[
f\left(G^{\prime}\right):=\left\{f(a) \mid a \in G^{\prime}\right\}
\]

is a subgroup of \(H\).\\
ii) Show that if \(H^{\prime}\) is a subgroup of \(H\), then

\[
f^{-1}\left(H^{\prime}\right):=\left\{a \in G \mid f(a) \in H^{\prime}\right\}
\]

is a subgroup of \(G\).

Problem 8. Let \(G\) be a group and \(H_{1}\) and \(H_{2}\) be subgroups of \(G\). Show that if \(H_{1} \cup H_{2}\) is a subgroup of \(G\), then either \(H_{1} \subseteq H_{2}\) or \(H_{2} \subseteq H_{1}\).
