Problem 1. Show that if \(G\) is a finite group, with \(|G|\) even, then \(G\) contains an element of order 2.

Problem 2. Show that every subgroup \(H\) of \(\mathbf{Z}\) is either equal to \(\{0\}\) or to \(n \mathbf{Z}\) for some positive integer \(n\). Hint: if \(H \neq\{0\}\), consider the smallest positive integer \(n\) such that \(n \in H\).

Problem 3. Prove that the multiplicative groups \(\mathbf{R}^{\times}\)and \(\mathbf{C}^{\times}\)are not isomorphic.\\
Problem 4. Show that for every element \(x\) of finite order \(|x|\) of a group \(G\) and every positive integer \(n\), the order \(\left|x^{n}\right|\) of \(x^{n}\) is \(\frac{|x|}{\operatorname{gcd}(|x|, n)}\).

Problem 5. Let \(m\) and \(n\) be positive integers.\\
i) Show that every group homomorphism \(f: \mathbf{Z} / m \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z} / n \mathbf{Z}\) is of the form

\[
x+m \mathbf{Z} \mapsto a x+n \mathbf{Z}
\]

for some \(a\) such that \(\frac{n}{d}\) divides \(a\), where \(d=\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)\).\\
ii) Show that in the situation in i), if we write \(a=\frac{n}{d} p\), then the class of \(p\) in \(\mathbf{Z} / d \mathbf{Z}\) is uniquely determined. Deduce that the set of group homomorphisms \(\mathbf{Z} / m \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z} / n \mathbf{Z}\) has \(d\) elements.

Problem 6. Show that if \(x\) and \(y\) are elements of a group \(G\) that commute (that is, \(x y=y x)\) and if \(|x|=a<\infty\) and \(|y|=b<\infty\) are such that \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime, then \(|x y|=a b\).
